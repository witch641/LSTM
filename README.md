# LSTM

## Dataset Description
Each entry in this dataset consists of a text segment representing a Twitter message and a corresponding label indicating the predominant emotion conveyed. The emotions are classified into six categories:
- Sadness (0)
- Joy (1)
- Love (2)
- Anger (3)
- Fear (4)
- Surprise (5)

Whether you're interested in sentiment analysis, emotion classification, or text mining, this dataset provides a rich foundation for exploring the nuanced emotional landscape within the realm of social media.

## Model Training
We built and trained a BiLSTM model, achieving an accuracy of 0.94 in emotion classification. The model's performance across different epochs was visualized to highlight the best epoch.

## Model Performance
To summarize the classification model's performance, we used a confusion matrix to compare the predicted labels against the true labels.
